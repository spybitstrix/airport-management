# ✈️ Smart Airport Management System

## 🏆 Hackathon Project (24-Hour Build)

A **role-based, automation-driven airport operations dashboard** designed to reduce flight delays, optimize gate allocation, and improve passenger communication.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Airports struggle with:

* Flight delays and poor visibility
* Gate conflicts and inefficient utilization
* Lack of real-time communication to staff and passengers

Our solution centralizes airport operations into **one smart system** with automation and analytics.
